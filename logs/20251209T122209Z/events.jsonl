Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07497v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07497v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07497v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: 48 pages, 3 tables, 2 listings\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_0PcX6oZReHzxkG328H0psOOl"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Enhancing Agentic RL with Progressive Reward Shaping and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Zhuoran Zhuang, Ye Chen, Jianghao Su, Chao Luo, Luhui Liu, Xia Zeng\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T11:59:25Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T11:59:25Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CL\\n\\nAbstract:\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) empowered with Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) can iteratively plan, call external tools, and integrate returned information to solve complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks. Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07478v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07478v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07478v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_8XGh4sX7zPGmyn3f5CCjY5n6"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: LocalSearchBench: Benchmarking Agentic Search in Real-World Local Life Services\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Hang He, Chuhuai Yue, Chengqi Dong, Mingxue Tian, Zhenfeng Liu, Jiajun Chai, Xiaohan Wang, Yufei Zhang, Qun Liao, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin, Chengcheng Wan, Haiying Sun, Ting Su\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T11:12:39Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T11:12:39Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nRecent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled agentic search systems to perform complex multi-step reasoning across multiple sources. However, most studies focus on general information retrieval and rarely explores vertical domains with unique challenges. In this work, we focus on local life services and introduce LocalSearchBench, which encompass diverse and complex business scenarios. Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed. As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench includes over 150,000 high-quality entries from various cities and business types. We construct 300 multi-hop QA tasks based on real user queries, challenging agents to understand questions and retrieve information in multiple steps. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for agent interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.1) achieves only 34.34% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 77.33%) and faithfulness (average 61.99%). This highlights the need for specialized benchmarks and domain-specific agent training in local life services.

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07287v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07287v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07287v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_WkK8OQoUmSwV6iQszjGgYxPL"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: DART: Leveraging Multi-Agent Disagreement for Tool Recruitment in Multimodal Reasoning\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Nithin Sivakumaran, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, David Wan, Yue Zhang, Jaehong Yoon, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T03:33:38Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T03:33:38Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CL, Additional: cs.AI, cs.CV\\n\\nAbstract:\\nSpecialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07132v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07132v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07132v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: Code: https://github.com/nsivaku/dart\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_wD154lptaGKNhjMqVuIx22jJ"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: VIGIL: A Reflective Runtime for Self-Healing Agents\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Christopher Cruz\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T02:18:41Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T02:18:41Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nAgentic LLM frameworks promise autonomous behavior via task decomposition, tool use, and iterative planning, but most deployed systems remain brittle. They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07094v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07094v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07094v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_6EmUW8jJ39C3k3KU1C8Ksjbj"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: MASim: Multilingual Agent-Based Simulation for Social Science\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Xuan Zhang, Wenxuan Zhang, Anxu Wang, See-Kiong Ng, Yang Deng\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T06:12:48Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T06:12:48Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CL, Additional: cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.MA, cs.SI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nMulti-agent role-playing has recently shown promise for studying social behavior with language agents, but existing simulations are mostly monolingual and fail to model cross-lingual interaction, an essential property of real societies. We introduce MASim, the first multilingual agent-based simulation framework that supports multi-turn interaction among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic profiles. MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions. Experiments on calibration, sensitivity, consistency, and cultural case studies show that MASim reproduces sociocultural phenomena and highlights the importance of multilingual simulation for scalable, controlled computational social science.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07195v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07195v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07195v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_lLdnBLrjLAmzgk7Dh8xVlvfs"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: VulnLLM-R: Specialized Reasoning LLM with Agent Scaffold for Vulnerability Detection\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Yuzhou Nie, Hongwei Li, Chengquan Guo, Ruizhe Jiang, Zhun Wang, Bo Li, Dawn Song, Wenbo Guo\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T13:06:23Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T13:06:23Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CR, Additional: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nWe propose VulnLLM-R, the~\\\\emph{first specialized reasoning LLM} for vulnerability detection. Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

Traditional information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) methods rely on unchanged bug descriptions, which often contain noisy information, leading to poor retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved bug localization through query reformulation, yet the effect on agent performance remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate how an LLM-powered agent can improve file-level bug localization via lightweight query reformulation and summarization. We first employ an open-source, non-fine-tuned LLM to extract key information from bug reports, such as identifiers and code snippets, and reformulate queries pre-retrieval. Our agent then orchestrates BM25 retrieval using these preprocessed queries, automating localization workflow at scale. Using the best-performing query reformulation technique, our agent achieves 35% better ranking in first-file retrieval than our BM25 baseline and up to +22% file retrieval performance over SWE-agent.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07022v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07022v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07022v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: Accepted at BoatSE 2026\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_Ieh68m5zATvNa4f7XlwkAwcQ"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Trung-Kiet Huynh, Duy-Minh Dao-Sy, Thanh-Bang Cao, Phong-Hao Le, Hong-Dan Nguyen, Phu-Quy Nguyen-Lam, Minh-Luan Nguyen-Vo, Hong-Phat Pham, Phu-Hoa Pham, Thien-Kim Than, Chi-Nguyen Tran, Huy Tran, Gia-Thoai Tran-Le, Alessio Buscemi, Le Hong Trang, The Anh Han\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T11:40:03Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T11:40:03Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.MA, Additional: cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LG, math.DS\\n\\nAbstract:\\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07462v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07462v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_3fh2vGu2Rj0YMkI4IRz6dEOW"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Training Language Models to Use Prolog as a Tool\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Niklas Mellgren, Peter Schneider-Kamp, Lukas Galke Poech\\n- Published: 2025-12-08T10:39:38Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-08T10:39:38Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CL\\n\\nAbstract:\\nEnsuring reliable tool use is critical for safe agentic AI systems. Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro. These results demonstrate that grounding model reasoning in formal verification systems substantially improves reliability and auditability for safety-critical applications.

Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07828v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07828v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07828v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_nui3JlRBg1EeahUasPtNDsDR"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_x7bEnyWoeYd6WNFapWODjL48", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "notion-create-pages", "arguments": "{\"pages\":[{\"content\":\"# 概览\\n本页整理了最近 arXiv 上与“Agent/Agentic AI”相关的论文，并提炼各自的核心实验方法与设置，便于快速复用到项目中。\\n<table_of_contents/>\\n\\n# 论文与核心实验方法\\n\\n## 1) How Do LLMs Fail In Agentic Scenarios?
