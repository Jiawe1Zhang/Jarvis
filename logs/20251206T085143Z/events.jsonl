BiTAgent（2512.04513）提出任务感知的模块化框架，将多模态 LLM 与世界模型双向耦合，强调“感知-建模-执行”的闭环。\n  - EnCompass（2512.03571）用“程序执行路径搜索”增强代理编程，减少脆弱性与死路，提高策略探索和纠错能力。\n  - 文档工作流自动化框架（2512.04445）采用“分步与回滚”的操作编排，体现了事务化与可恢复的代理执行范式。\n  - Persona-based 多智能体协作（2512.04488）显示“角色/视角多样性”有助于更全面的创意与决策。\n\n- 自进化/自我改进与训练生态\n  - Nex-N1（2512.04987）强调从模仿学习转向“激励驱动决策”，构建统一的环境生态来支撑大规模 agent 训练与评测。\n  - SEAL（2512.04868）在对话式知识图谱 QA 中实现“自进化学习”，通过循环式的反思与修正提升复杂推理能力。\n\n- 可靠性与可验证性\n  - E-valuator（2512.03109）用序贯假设检验做“代理行动验证”，将不确定性估计引入到步骤级审核中，降低幻觉与错误执行风险。\n  - 长上下文 WebAgents 评测（2512.04307）指出长交互历史下的推理与记忆稳定性瓶颈，呼吁更贴近真实任务的评测设计。\n\n- 安全与治理（对抗面、机制与规范）\n  - AGENTSAFE（2512.03180）提出统一的伦理与治理框架，覆盖规划、工具使用、反馈控制与问责链路。\n  - ASTRIDE（2512.04785）提供 Agentic-AI 的安全威胁建模平台，聚焦系统化威胁识别与缓解。\n  - Beyond Single-Agent Safety（2512.02682）与 Topology Matters（2512.04668）、Tipping the Dominos（2512.04129）从多智能体交互、图拓扑与多跳攻击视角，揭示 LLM-to-LLM 交互的新风险面。\n\n- 领域化框架与工具链\n  - 安全测试/模糊测试：HarnessAgent（2512.03420）、PBFuzz（2512.04611）将代理式流水线引入安全工程。\n  - 临床决策 Orchestrator（2512.04207）与多模态/具身智能 BiTAgent 展示了“领域定制+通用模式”的结合路径。\n\n通用设计模式（近期共识）\n- 模块化：规划器/执行器/记忆/工具/验证器/世界模型解耦，接口清晰便于替换与演进。\n- 外部验证与监控：在关键步骤引入审计（如序贯检验、规则校验、投票/仲裁），用以抑制幻觉与错误放大。\n- 事务化与回滚：对外部环境有副作用的操作采用“预演-提交/回滚”以保证一致性与可恢复性。\n- 记忆与拓扑：将记忆组织为图或分层结构，关注多代理通信拓扑对泄漏与鲁棒性的影响。\n- 策略/规则声明式约束：用可执行规则或策略语言把治理与合规嵌入到代理执行链路中。\n- 世界模型与环境：用仿真/合成数据与世界模型加速训练与评测，提高泛化与安全性。\n\n开放问题\n- 真实环境的稳健泛化与可复现实验设计；跨任务迁移仍具挑战。\n- 长上下文与记忆的可控性、可审计与成本权衡。\n- 安全对抗面不断扩展（注入、多跳链式攻击、拓扑泄漏），需要工程与理论并进。\n- 评价基准碎片化，标准化与可比性仍需加强；小模型与成本效率的可行路径有待验证。\n\n部分参考（arXiv ID）\n- BiTAgent: 2512.04513\n- EnCompass: 2512.03571\n- Nex-N1: 2512.04987\n- SEAL: 2512.04868\n- E-valuator: 2512.03109\n- AGENTSAFE: 2512.03180\n- ASTRIDE: 2512.04785\n- Beyond Single-Agent Safety: 2512.02682\n- Topology Matters: 2512.04668\n- Tipping the Dominos: 2512.04129\n- Evaluating Long-Context Reasoning in WebAgents: 2512.04307\n- Automating Complex Document Workflows: 2512.04445\n- Persona-based Multi-Agent Collaboration: 2512.04488\n（如需，我可把每篇的链接与一行摘要也附上。）\n\n关于写入 Notion\n- 我在你的工作区里没有找到名为“我的笔记”的页面。请确认要把本总结写到哪里：\n  1) 我帮你新建一个页面（建议标题：近期 Agent Framework 论文综述（arXiv，2025-12-06））\n  2) 写入你现有页面之一（请二选一或指定其他页面）：\n     -
