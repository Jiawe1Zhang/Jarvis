Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01939v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.01939v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01939v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_cisRDcujLXUXH4QuN2xXlUc9"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Orchestration Framework for Financial Agents: From Algorithmic Trading to Agentic Trading\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Jifeng Li, Arnav Grover, Abraham Alpuerto, Yupeng Cao, Xiao-Yang Liu\\n- Published: 2025-12-01T21:50:22Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-01T21:50:22Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.MA, Additional: cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.LG\\n\\nAbstract:\\nThe financial market is a mission-critical playground for AI agents due to its temporal dynamics and low signal-to-noise ratio.

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21990v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2511.21990v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21990v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_a09hMSnotuxOIzFcLQo2KUGk"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Matrix: Peer-to-Peer Multi-Agent Synthetic Data Generation Framework\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Dong Wang, Yang Li, Ansong Ni, Ching-Feng Yeh, Youssef Emad, Xinjie Lei, Liam Robbins, Karthik Padthe, Hu Xu, Xian Li, Asli Celikyilmaz, Ramya Raghavendra, Lifei Huang, Carole-Jean Wu, Shang-Wen Li\\n- Published: 2025-11-26T18:59:28Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-11-26T18:59:28Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CL, Additional: cs.AI, cs.LG\\n\\nAbstract:\\nSynthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \\\\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\\\\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21686v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2511.21686v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21686v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_C9U0wmDDSWsi9Y5yKpvjs48g"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Yu-Wei Zhan, Xin Wang, Pengzhe Mao, Tongtong Feng, Ren Wang, Wenwu Zhu\\n- Published: 2025-12-04T06:49:50Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-04T06:49:50Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nBuilding generalist embodied agents requires a unified system that can interpret multimodal goals, model environment dynamics, and execute reliable actions across diverse real-world tasks. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04513v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04513v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04513v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_iQxMUJQxJxYVSA01nMaz6pCU"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: EnCompass: Enhancing Agent Programming with Search Over Program Execution Paths\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Zhening Li, Armando Solar-Lezama, Yisong Yue, Stephan Zheng\\n- Published: 2025-12-03T08:50:16Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-03T08:50:16Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI, Additional: cs.LG, cs.PL\\n\\nAbstract:\\nWe introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \\\"reversed-objective\\\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04416v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04416v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04416v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: Equal contribution: Zhou Liu and Zhaoyang Han.

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow. The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation. We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04307v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04307v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04307v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: Accepted NeurIPS 25 LAW Workshop\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_RbQpNSTurGgX3jmueIdvr7CC"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: ASTRIDE: A Security Threat Modeling Platform for Agentic-AI Applications\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Eranga Bandara, Amin Hass, Ross Gore, Sachin Shetty, Ravi Mukkamala, Safdar H.

However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04785v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04785v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04785v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_Oy4QkaCXLiVRKKIkLtiZt8Ik"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Aetheria: A multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Yuxiang He, Jian Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, Tianle Zhang, Wei Cai, Haojie Cheng, Ziyan Shi, Ming Zhu, Haichuan Tang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li\\n- Published: 2025-12-02T08:49:54Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-02T08:49:54Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nThe exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety.

Matrix: Peer-to-Peer Multi-Agent Synthetic Data Generation Framework（arXiv:2511.21686）提出用分布式队列串联“控制流+数据流”，去掉中心编排器，在相同硬件下合成数据吞吐提升约2–15倍。\n- 角色化/模块化编排是通用模式\n  - 金融领域编排框架（arXiv:2512.02227）将传统量化系统映射为“规划-风控-投资组合-回测-执行-审计-记忆”等多代理角色，展示了面向任务的可组合性与可运营性。\n  - DataGovAgent（伴随基准 GovBench，arXiv:2512.04416）采用 Planner-Executor-Evaluator 架构、约束规划+RAG+沙箱化调试，显著提升复杂数据治理任务的端到端可靠性。\n\n二、编程范式与可维护性\n- 将“工作流逻辑”与“推理/搜索策略”解耦\n  - EnCompass（arXiv:2512.03571）通过“概率天使式非确定性”模型，让开发者在不改工作流代码的情况下切换/组合推理策略（如树搜索），提升可测试性与可移植性。\n- 可配置的层级化研究代理\n  - Static-DRA（arXiv:2512.03887）用树形静态工作流，以“深度/广度”两参控制研究强度与成本，在可解释的流程下实现性能-成本权衡。\n- 与世界模型的双向耦合\n  - BiTAgent（arXiv:2512.04513）提出 MLLM 语义空间与世界模型潜在动态的双向耦合路径（前向语义注入+后向密集奖励），提升多任务与跨环境泛化。\n\n三、人类在环与多智能体协同\n- 专家在环（HITL）加速工具生成与对齐\n  - CollabToolBuilder（arXiv:2512.01434）以 Coach/Coder/Critic/Capitalizer 四代理迭代生成与验证工具，用系统化人类反馈稳态强化各子角色职责。\n- 多代理辩论提升可解释安全判断\n  - Aetheria（arXiv:2512.02530）用检索增强+多代理辩论协作产出可追溯的审计报告，在隐含风险识别与可解释性上优于单模型管线。\n\n四、安全与威胁建模（Safety & Security）\n- 安全与安全性是“系统交互”的涌现属性\n  - NVIDIA 团队提出企业级 Agentic 系统安全-安全性一体化框架（arXiv:2511.21990），强调工具链、编排器、数据与环境交互引入的新型风险，并用“沙箱 AI 红队”做动态风险发现与缓解。\n- 为 Agentic 应用扩展传统威胁模型\n  - ASTRIDE（arXiv:2512.04785）在 STRIDE 上新增“Agent 特有攻击”（如提示注入、工具误用、推理劫持），并用多模态+LLM 组合从架构图自动化威胁建模。\n\n五、评测与经验\n- 现实工作流导向的基准更能暴露系统短板\n  - GovBench（arXiv:2512.04416）基于真实数据治理情境构建“反目标”噪声与端到端可靠性指标，显示现有代理在多步、纠错方面仍薄弱。\n  - WebAgents 长上下文评测（arXiv:2512.04307）发现上下文增大至 25k–150k tokens 时成功率大幅下降，常见失败为“循环停滞/遗忘目标”，提示需引入显式长期记忆与过程监控。\n- 开发者实践的痛点与差异\n  - 实证研究（arXiv:2512.01939）基于近 1.2 万条讨论，给出框架在“开发效率、抽象、学习成本、性能优化、可维护性”等维度的显著差异；超 80% 开发者难以选型，表明需要更清晰的抽象边界与文档/工具链支持。\n\n六、共识与分歧（从这些论文可见）\n- 共识\n  - 框架应模块化、显式规划与反馈回路、沙箱化执行与可观察性、与检索/工具的稳健集成、提供可插拔的搜索/自我改进策略。\n  - 长期记忆与状态管理是可靠性的关键；人类在环与多代理协作可显著提升质量与对齐。\n  - 安全需要前置于设计：将安全与安全性（security）作统一的运行时风险管理，而非模型级静态属性。\n- 分歧/探索方向\n  - 中央编排器 vs 去中心化消息总线：去中心化带来扩展性与容错，但增加全局可观测性与一致性成本。\n  - 通用框架 vs 领域专用流程（金融/治理/安全）：后者更易落地但可迁移性较弱。\n  - 语义大模型与世界模型的耦合深度、训练信号设计与代价，是 embodied/工具型代理的开放问题。\n\n七、落地建议（结合上述结论）\n- 选型时优先框架特性：计划-执行-评估解耦、可替换的推理/搜索策略、消息/事件驱动与可观测性、内置沙箱与权限边界、易于集成记忆与RAG。\n- 建立即用即评的基准与SLO：引入领域真实任务集与端到端正确性/恢复力指标；在长上下文场景做专项回归。\n- 安全内建：采用 ASTRIDE 类威胁建模，覆盖提示注入、工具误用、链式升级风险；常态化自动红队。\n- 人类在环与多代理协作：将专家反馈接口与角色化协同作为一等公民能力。\n\n代表性论文快速索引\n- Matrix: 去中心化多代理数据合成框架（2511.21686）\n- 金融代理编排（2512.02227）\n- EnCompass: 工作流/推理策略解耦（2512.03571）\n- Static-DRA: 层级可配置研究代理（2512.03887）\n- BiTAgent: MLLM-World Model 双向耦合（2512.04513）\n- Aetheria: 多代理辩论式内容安全（2512.02530）\n- ASTRIDE: Agentic-AI 威胁建模（2512.04785）\n- Agentic 安全-安全性一体化框架（2511.21990）\n- GovBench + DataGovAgent（2512.04416）\n- WebAgents 长上下文评测（2512.04307）\n- Agent 框架开发者实践实证（2512.01939）\n\n需要我按你的应用场景（如金融、企业自动化、内容安全等）进一步筛选推荐框架和设计要点，或导出这些论文的 BibTeX 吗？"}, {"role": "user", "content": "把你刚才这些内容写到我的Notion页面里, 新建一个叫做Agent框架总结的page, 把内容写进去!"}], "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_VnpkpNdq2KjYwyESR1uT5BaS", "name": "notion-create-pages", "arguments": "{\"pages\":[{\"content\":\"说明：本页汇总了近期 arXiv 上与 “Agent Framework / Agentic 系统框架” 直接相关的论文要点与趋势，侧重框架设计、编排、安全、评测和落地建议，便于快速选型与实践。\\n\\n# 一、体系结构与编排（Orchestration）\\n- 去中心化与消息驱动提高可扩展性与吞吐\\n  -

Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01939v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.01939v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01939v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_cisRDcujLXUXH4QuN2xXlUc9"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Orchestration Framework for Financial Agents: From Algorithmic Trading to Agentic Trading\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Jifeng Li, Arnav Grover, Abraham Alpuerto, Yupeng Cao, Xiao-Yang Liu\\n- Published: 2025-12-01T21:50:22Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-01T21:50:22Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.MA, Additional: cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.LG\\n\\nAbstract:\\nThe financial market is a mission-critical playground for AI agents due to its temporal dynamics and low signal-to-noise ratio. Building an effective algorithmic trading system may require a professional team to develop and test over the years. In this paper, we propose an orchestration framework for financial agents, which aims to democratize financial intelligence to the general public. We map each component of the traditional algorithmic trading system to agents, including planner, orchestrator, alpha agents, risk agents, portfolio agents, backtest agents, execution agents, audit agents, and memory agent. We present two in-house trading examples. For the stock trading task (hourly data from 04/2024 to 12/2024), our approach achieved a return of $20.42\\\\%$, a Sharpe ratio of 2.63, and a maximum drawdown of $-3.59\\\\%$, while the S&P 500 index yielded a return of $15.97\\\\%$. For the BTC trading task (minute data from 27/07/2025 to 13/08/2025), our approach achieved a return of $8.39\\\\%$, a Sharpe ratio of $0.38$, and a maximum drawdown of $-2.80\\\\%$, whereas the BTC price increased by $3.80\\\\%$.

The architecture generates and validates tools via four specialized agents (Coach, Coder, Critic, Capitalizer) using a reinforced dynamic prompt and systematic human feedback integration to reinforce each agent's role toward goals and constraints. This work is best viewed as a system-level integration and methodology combining multi-agent in-context learning, HITL controls, and reusable tool capitalization for complex iterative problems such as scientific document generation.

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21990v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2511.21990v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21990v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_a09hMSnotuxOIzFcLQo2KUGk"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Matrix: Peer-to-Peer Multi-Agent Synthetic Data Generation Framework\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Dong Wang, Yang Li, Ansong Ni, Ching-Feng Yeh, Youssef Emad, Xinjie Lei, Liam Robbins, Karthik Padthe, Hu Xu, Xian Li, Asli Celikyilmaz, Ramya Raghavendra, Lifei Huang, Carole-Jean Wu, Shang-Wen Li\\n- Published: 2025-11-26T18:59:28Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-11-26T18:59:28Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.CL, Additional: cs.AI, cs.LG\\n\\nAbstract:\\nSynthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \\\\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\\\\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21686v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2511.21686v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21686v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_C9U0wmDDSWsi9Y5yKpvjs48g"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Yu-Wei Zhan, Xin Wang, Pengzhe Mao, Tongtong Feng, Ren Wang, Wenwu Zhu\\n- Published: 2025-12-04T06:49:50Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-04T06:49:50Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nBuilding generalist embodied agents requires a unified system that can interpret multimodal goals, model environment dynamics, and execute reliable actions across diverse real-world tasks. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04513v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04513v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04513v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_iQxMUJQxJxYVSA01nMaz6pCU"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: EnCompass: Enhancing Agent Programming with Search Over Program Execution Paths\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Zhening Li, Armando Solar-Lezama, Yisong Yue, Stephan Zheng\\n- Published: 2025-12-03T08:50:16Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-03T08:50:16Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI, Additional: cs.LG, cs.PL\\n\\nAbstract:\\nWe introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents.

We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \\\"reversed-objective\\\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04416v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04416v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04416v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: Equal contribution: Zhou Liu and Zhaoyang Han.

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow. The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation. We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04307v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04307v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04307v1\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- Comment: Accepted NeurIPS 25 LAW Workshop\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_RbQpNSTurGgX3jmueIdvr7CC"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: ASTRIDE: A Security Threat Modeling Platform for Agentic-AI Applications\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Eranga Bandara, Amin Hass, Ross Gore, Sachin Shetty, Ravi Mukkamala, Safdar H.

However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications.\\n\\nAccess Options:\\n- Abstract page: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04785v1\\n- Full text HTML version: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04785v1\\n- PDF version: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04785v1\\n\"]", "tool_call_id": "call_Oy4QkaCXLiVRKKIkLtiZt8Ik"}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[\"Title: Aetheria: A multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration\\n\\nMetadata:\\n- Authors: Yuxiang He, Jian Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, Tianle Zhang, Wei Cai, Haojie Cheng, Ziyan Shi, Ming Zhu, Haichuan Tang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li\\n- Published: 2025-12-02T08:49:54Z\\n- Last Updated: 2025-12-02T08:49:54Z\\n- Categories: Primary: cs.AI\\n\\nAbstract:\\nThe exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety.
